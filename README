MUT - Minimal Unit Test for Scala

==Highlight==
Do you have a bunch of test cases which require similar but not identical setup?
Do you wish to have very precise control over the abnormal conditions in test case execution?
Do you need a unit test library that is tiny and has only one class?

Look no further than MUT :-)

==Features==
Timed execution of test cases.
Test case setup and clean-up.
Super easy test case reset.
Super easy and very precise control over abnormal conditions in test case.
Single class with only around 100 lines of code!

Usage example is in MutExample.scala.

==Background==
As a novice Scala learner, I started a pet project called ScalaDB (flat file DB engine in Scala, https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/ScalaDB).
I wish to write unit test cases for ScalaDB, so I learned some Scala unit testing tools but found them:
- large
- inflexible test case setup
- difficult to code for abnormal condition detection
The above reasons drove me to write this tiny unit testing library to be used in my ScalaDB.
